# Demo script (3 minutes) — Bécar Operational Controller Cockpit

## 0) Context (15 sec)
"This demo shows how I maintain operational KPIs (cost/hour, cost/m³, cost/km), drill down to profitability and variances, and convert negative variances into a structured action plan with traceability. The data is synthetic for confidentiality."

## 1) KPI Cockpit (45 sec)
- Show the KPIs and filters (subsidiary / activity / contract / equipment).
- Highlight top contracts/equipment driving cost per km and cost per hour.

## 2) Profitability & Variance (45 sec)
- Open the Variance page: show where actual cost rates exceed targets.
- Drill down to the root causes (fuel share, downtime, maintenance).

## 3) Action plan (CAPA) (45 sec)
- Generate CAPA proposals from the top variances.
- Show ownership, due dates, and status tracking.
- Emphasize traceability / audit trail.

## 4) MIR readiness (30 sec)
- Show the MIR template and quality checks.
- Explain how the same data discipline helps the MIR maintenance software rollout.
